# hello-world

Hi world! I'm Lawrence Mak but my pals call me Lmak. 

I'm learning & practicing the fundamentals of Computer Science on daily basis so that I can become one of the best software engineers in the world.

I'm currently going through the Free Code Camp: Full-Stack curriculum in Javascript.

San Francisco born & raised and it will always be home even if I move to New York or someplace else. 

I believe food is the key to happiness and fat is flavor!!!
